## ✨ What is Soc Ops?

**Soc Ops** (Social Operations) is a web-based Social Bingo game designed for in-person mixers, team events, conferences, and workshops. Instead of awkward small talk, participants explore the room with purpose—discovering shared experiences, unique stories, and unexpected connections.

Built with **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**, it's a perfect example of modern frontend development and a fantastic learning project for exploring AI-assisted coding workflows.
